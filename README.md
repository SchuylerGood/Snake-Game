# Snake Game

## Description
This is a re creation of the classic **Snake** game built using Python. It uses Pygame, and has all original art assets. I choose Pygame and Python as the primary language because at the time it was the only language I knew, as I was just starting to get into programming.

## Libraries Used:
 - Pygame
 - Random
 - Time
